## Avenger-AI

It can recognise 6 of the marvel actors in Avengers, I repeat only the actors so their characters cant be recognised properly. 
The actors it can recognise include Robert Downey Jr.(Tony Stark), Chris Hemsworth(Thor), Chris Evans(Steve Rogers), Scarlet Johnasson(Natasha Romanoff),Jeremy Renner(Clint Barton), Mark Ruffalo(Bruce Banner)

## What it uses

It uses resnet50 model for training and fitting. Code in train.py
And Flask manages the website with the prediction model. Code in app.py
It uses https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishabhkmr/avengers-actors-images-dataset as the dataset
